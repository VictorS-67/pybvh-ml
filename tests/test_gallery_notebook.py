"""Freshness guard for the committed feature-gallery notebook.

The gallery's docs page is generated from the *committed outputs* of
``gallery/feature_gallery.ipynb`` (no execution at docs-build time), so a stale
notebook publishes stale figures. These tests make the two failure modes
loud:

- the jupytext pair drifting (``.py`` edited, ``.ipynb`` not re-synced),
- outputs not regenerated after an edit (non-sequential / missing
  execution counts, exactly the state a partial re-run leaves behind),

plus basic hygiene: no error outputs and no stderr in what gets published.
CI executes the notebook itself in ``test.yml`` (nbmake), which
catches cells that no longer run; these checks catch cells that were
never re-run.
